                <p>When given this project in course IAT313 (Narrative and New Media) we were tasked with creating a 2-5 minute linear narrative in a medium of our choice, in groups of 1-4 people. Given my keen interest in 3d rendering at the time and the fact that I had a week off school coming up, I challenged myself to create my first ever 3d animation, and given the lack of other classmates with 3d experience I did it alone. Throughout that week I created this project and learned a lot about the workflow of animation, and why nobody should ever try to create one alone in a single week.</p>

            <h3>Process:</h3>
            <p>While the animation took the majority of the time, the first, and most important step in creating this film was to develop the story, and plan out a script and shot list. Having these helped the animation process go smoothly without the need to stop and think of what to do next. Throughout the process I improvised a few shots and strayed from the original shot list after having a visual of the scene, however having the shot list available helped me understand the importance of early planning.</p>

                <div class="imageDescriptionText">
                    <p>After script and shotlist creation, I started creating the characters. Given my limited experience in modelling and lack of any experience animating complex 3d meshes, I decided to make the character a robot which allowed me to modify and combine basic shapes to create a more complex character design, and create movement through rotation of joints.</p>

            <p>After modelling the characters and the environment, it was time to animate it all. This was done by setting up different cameras, keyframing the character and camera movement, and switching between cameras to properly seperate the different shots that were initially defined in the shot list.</p>

            <p>The animation process took a long time, and once it was done I used Adobe Premiere Pro to edit all the shots together, adjust the color of the scenes, and do all the sound design. Below are a couple shots from the film that I am especially proud of in terms of animation and camera direction.</p>

            <h3>Reflections:</h3>
            <p>First reflection, this project was exhausting. With such a short timeframe, and little to no actual animation experience, creating an entire short film from scratch was definitely more than I should have taken on, however through those constraints I was able to learn a lot and ended up overall very happy with the result. The amount I learned about animation and visual storytelling is something I think will help me a lot in the future. <br><br>Specifically I think I learned that setting up a good animation workflow and a way to differentiate scenes is incredibly important. Starting from scratch and not knowing where to start, I started animating the characters and switching between scenes on exact frames. Something I wish I had done was leaving extra time on the beginning and endings of each shot to allow more creative freedom in the editing process. At one point I had to go back and re-render a scene since the timing did not work out how I imagined and I wanted a certain shot to be longer to help build tension. Going forward, when I start my next animation project I will apply what I learned to prevent any troubles in the editing stage.</p>
