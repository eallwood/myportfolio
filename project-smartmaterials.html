                <p>Created as a course project in IAT235 (Information Design) this website design was built to represent an art exhibit that explored the creative use of 'smart materials'. By enforcing the ideas of experimentation and exploration found in the exhibit, this website uses the visual metaphor of a tabletop in which all content is easily discoverable. While this was done as part of a group project, we created multiple concepts during one of the weeks and I created the vast majority of this one outside of copywriting and finding the images of the curators and exhibits.</p>

            <h3>Constraints &amp; Process:</h3>
            <p>This was a project completed over 5 weeks in different stages. Through the first 3 weeks we were tasked with developing a visual identity by taking inspiration from specific characteristics of a chosen designer and creating posters for the exhibit. Our group was taking inspiration from the designer Emigre, and while we explored many different aspects of their work, the one which most influenced this project was the idea of creating depth through constrasting texture. The following is one of the 3 visual identities we crafted in the 3rd week, and was the basis for this websites visual design.</p>
            <div class="imageRow">
                <div class="rowMember" style="flex:1">
                    <img src="img/categories/uxdesign/smartMaterialsPoster1.png">
                </div>
                <div class="rowMember" style="flex:1">
                    <img src="img/categories/uxdesign/smartMaterialsPoster2.png">
                </div>
                <div class="rowMember" style="flex:1">
                    <img src="img/categories/uxdesign/smartMaterialsPoster3.png">
                </div>
                <div class="rowMember" style="flex:1">
                    <img src="img/categories/uxdesign/smartMaterialsPoster4.png">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The visual design of these posters was meant to use tactile textures emulating the feeling of touch which was an imortant theme in the exhibit. The textures helped connect with the theme but would not allow easy readability, so we created separation by leaving the content on a raised card, using the title as a cutout to re-state the importance of the texture in the design. It was this separation of texture using raised cards and the feeling of touch that helped define how this style translated into the website design.</p>
            
            <h3>Design Explanations:</h3>
            <div class="imageDescription">
                <div class="imageDescriptionText">
                    <p>The main design goal of this website was to mimic the explorative nature of the exhibit. This was done using the visual metaphor of the tabletop where the navigation was represented by objects on the table that could be interacted with.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="imageDescriptionImage">
                    <img src="img/categories/uxdesign/smartMaterialsMenu.png">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="imageDescription reverseOrder">
                <div class="imageDescriptionText">
                    <p>Adding to the ideas of free exploration, the website leaves all navigation items on the screen, allowing the user to switch between sections in a single click.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="imageDescriptionImage">
                    <img src="img/categories/uxdesign/smartMaterialsCurators.png">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="imageDescription">
                <div class="imageDescriptionText">
                    <p>While the website is largely appealing to users who want to browse and explore, the landing page offers immediate links to each area of the site for more purpose-driven users to get the information they need.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="imageDescriptionImage">
                    <img src="img/categories/uxdesign/smartMaterialsHome.png">
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Critiques &amp; Moving Forward:</h3>
            <p>Within the course this was made for, we had weekly critique sessions at every stage of the project. This website prototype was created in week 4 and recieved mostly positive feedback, however compared to our teams other designs this concept was not very scalable if more content was required. The current design allows easy navigation between the content that does exist, however the text is tightly packed into the cards and has no room to expand. <br> <br> Given more time to work on this microsite, I would create a button to expand each card to cover most of the screen, displaying a scrollable page on top of what already exists with as much space as necessary for new content. For the last week of this project, we had to choose between two paths of either polishing this idea with improved content surfacing, or combining the best elements of our other two concepts. In the end we decided on the other option as this prototype had less room for growth, and we felt it was best to have more learning opportunities in the last week of the course.</p>
            
            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
            <p>What I feel I learned most from this project was how impactful a good navigation can be for a website. While some aspects of our other concepts were very strong, our final week's project did not feel completely cohesive and still felt like two separate websites put together rather than one cohesive unit. Comparing the project shown here with our final result, while the final prototype had a very creative homepage design and a more effective way of displaying content, this project felt better to use because it felt cohesive and easy to navigate.</p>
